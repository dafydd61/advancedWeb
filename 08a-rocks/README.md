## I picks ’em up, I gives ’em away.

This is a demo database-driven app. It does a few very basic things with a mySQL database:

1. Create a record
2. List (read) records
3. Update a record
4. Delete a record

There are some things it doesn't do, also, like:

1. Displaying records in a specific order (ORDER BY)
2. Filtering records (WHERE)
