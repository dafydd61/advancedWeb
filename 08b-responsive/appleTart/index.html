		<h1>Apple Tart</h1>
		<p>Borrowed from <em><a href="http://www.atypeprimer.com/">A Type Primer</a></em> by John Kane.</p>
		<div id="description">
			<p>This classic French Apple Tart, or Tarte aux Pommes, gives you a double dose of apples, a layer of nicely flavored apple sauce topped with a layer of sauteed apples slices. You will notice that the edges of the apples are beautifully brown and crisp and this is done by placing the baked tart briefly under the broiler. The finishing touch is to glaze the apples with apricot preserves to give them an attractive sheen with the added bonus of keeping the apples wonderfully moist. I like to serve this French Apple Tart warm with vanilla ice cream or a dollop of softly whipped cream or creme fraiche.</p>

			<h2>Instructions</h2>
			<h3>The shell</h3>
			<p>In a food processor fitted with a steel blade, combine all the ingredients until they form a solid mass that rises above the blade. You can add extra water by the table spoon if the mass does not congeal within the first minute. Tiny pieces of butter should still be visible in the dough when it&rsquo;s done. Remove the dough from the bowl and quickly work it into a ball on a lightly floured surface. Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least half an hour.</p>
			<p>After the dough has rested in the refrigerator, roll it out on a lightly floured surface until it forms a circle approximately 13&Prime; in diameter. Centre the circle of dough in a 10-inch tart pan with a removable bottom. Use your knuckles to make sure that the dough tucks nearly against the edge of the pan and run the rolling pin around the rim to remove the excess. Cover and refrigerate again for at least half an hour.</p>
			<p>Line the tart shell with aluminum foil, being careful to cover the edges. Piece the aluminum and the dough several times with a fork and fill the shell with dried lentils. Bake for 20 minutes. Remove the aluminum and the lentils and continue baking until the shell is golden brown, about 15 minutes more.</p>
			<h3>The apples</h3>
			<p>Peel, core and halve the apples. Either by hand or with a food processor, cut the apple halves crosswise into thin (less than 1/4&Prime;) slices. In a large bowl, toss the apples in the lemon juice, cinnamon and nutmeg. Cover and set aside.</p>
			<h3>The pastry cream</h3>
			<p>Sift the sugar, flour and cornstarch together in a mix bowl. Add the egg and beat until light. In a heavy-bottomed saucepan, bring the milk to a boil. Stir half the milk into the egg mixture, then pour the whole mixture back into the saucepan. Cook over high heat, stirring constantly, until the center bubbles and the mixture is very thick. Remove from heat and stir in the vanilla and the butter. Pour the pastry cream into a bowl, cover tightly with plastic wrap and refrigerate. (Be sure to press the plastic wrap right onto the cream to prevent a skin foam from forming.)</p>
			<h3>The assembly and baking</h3>
			<p>Preheat to 400&deg;</p>
			<p>Spread the pastry cream over the bottom of the shell. Arrange the apple slices in a circle around the outer edge of the shell, making sure the slices overlap. When the outer circle is completed, make a smaller circle, overlapping about half of the outer circle. If there&rsquo;s room,make a third circle. Fill the hole in the centre with pieces of a few slices&mdash;let them stand upright. Cover the tart with a circle of wax paper and bake for 25 minutes. Remove the wax paper and sprinkle the sugar over the apples. Bake uncovered for 5-10 minutes more, until the sugar melts.</p>
			<p>Boil the currant jelly until it reduces by one-third. With a pastry brush, paint the top of the tart with the current glaze. Allow time for the glaze to set before serving (10 minutes).</p>
